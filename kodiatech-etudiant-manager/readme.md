For a simple student management system, you might consider the following entities and their relationships:

### Entities

1. **Student**
   - **Attributes**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `dateOfBirth`, `enrollmentDate`, etc.

2. **Course**
   - **Attributes**: `id`, `name`, `description`, `credits`, etc.

3. **Enrollment**
   - **Attributes**: `id`, `studentId`, `courseId`, `enrollmentDate`, etc.

4. **Instructor**
   - **Attributes**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `department`, etc.

5. **Department** (optional)
   - **Attributes**: `id`, `name`, `location`, etc.

### Relationships

1. **Student - Course (Many-to-Many)**
   - A student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students. This relationship is typically represented by the **Enrollment** entity, which holds the foreign keys to both `Student` and `Course`.

2. **Course - Instructor (Many-to-One)**
   - A course is taught by one instructor, but an instructor can teach multiple courses.

3. **Student - Department (Many-to-One)** (optional)
   - If you want to categorize students by department, each student can belong to one department, but a department can have multiple students.

### Example Entity Models

#### Student.java
```java
public class Student {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private LocalDate dateOfBirth;
    private LocalDate enrollmentDate;
    private Department department; // optional
    // Getters and Setters
}
```

#### Course.java
```java
public class Course {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private int credits;
    private Instructor instructor; // Many-to-One relationship
    // Getters and Setters
}
```

#### Enrollment.java
```java
public class Enrollment {
    private Long id;
    private Long studentId; // Foreign key
    private Long courseId;  // Foreign key
    private LocalDate enrollmentDate;
    // Getters and Setters
}
```

#### Instructor.java
```java
public class Instructor {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String department;
    // Getters and Setters
}
```

#### Department.java (optional)
```java
public class Department {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String location;
    // Getters and Setters
}
```

### Summary

In summary, for a basic student management system, you would typically have at least **4-5 entities** (Student, Course, Enrollment, Instructor, and optionally Department) with the relationships outlined. Adjust the entities and relationships based on your specific requirements.
